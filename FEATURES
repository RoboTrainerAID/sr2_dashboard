1) Timeout for services set 0 (check docs rospy.wait_for_service(...))
  --> Actually this might be useful. The service call request is sent AFTER checking if the service is actually available
2) Custom icons
3) Rework view widgets for ext. process and service calls: merge the status label with the button; put metadata (package, node, service name etc.) as button's tooltip
4) Mapping view
5) Rviz widget (without Time view at the bottom)
  --> Seems not possible. RViz is written in C++. Calling C++ in Python is possible but
      doing that with RViz seems like a bad idea...
6) Define width/height of widgets in context
7) Add custom widgets
  --> This has always been possible but requires the user to become a developer and do it him-/herself
